This is a lightweight and very basic LIFO (Last In First Out) abstract data type.
The API (Application Programming Interface or the "user manual" for the funcitons) can be found in the "lifo.h" file. 

To use this library you must:

1) Put lifo.h in the same file as your project, or in a file in the include path (the directories in this "path" are listed in the INCLUDE environment variable). You can add more directory paths to this environment variable.

2) Put lifo.c somewhere in your project directories.

3) Any .c file that uses functions from the library must have '#include "lifo.h"' before the main body of the code.

4) lifo.c (or its object file "lifo.o") must be linked when compiling the final executable of your program.
